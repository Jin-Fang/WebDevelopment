HTML Tags

line break: <br> (only have opening tag)
horizontal rul: <hr> (only have closing tag)
heading: <h1></h1>, <h2></h2> ...

predefined attributes: attribute name => attribute value
<p id="myId">   </p> 
(must have one space after the p)
(HTML5 doesn't require to use quote for the attribute value)
(quote into quote the same as Python)

HTML structure

<html> -> <head> -> <meta charset="utf-8"> -> <title> -> </head>

block-level element
- render to begin on a new line by defalt
- may contain inline or other block-level elements

inline elements

<div></div> is block-level element
<span></span> is inline elements
<img src="www."> is inline elemenet


Semantic html elements
- the element that implies some meaning to the content


Escape three characters and use entity reference
< : &lt
> : &gt
& : &amp
copy right: &copy
non-breaking space: &nbsp (use it in between text that should not seperate when web size is changing)
" : &quot;

target="_blank" - open the link in a new tab

use <a href="#top"></a> to link to the part with id = "top"

image:
if url is broken, it will break the layout as image won't show
if width and height are specified, and the url is broken, the space will be blank for that image and make the layout intact
